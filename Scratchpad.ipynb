        "*   The AI would scan trending hashtags, challenges, and pop-culture conversations on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X, focusing on data access, analysis, engagement metrics, and volume of posts to filter and prioritize trends based on virality and relevance to sustainable living.\n",
        "*   Criteria for selecting eco-friendly trends include high engagement, relevance to sustainable living, adaptability to integrate sustainable actions, potential for positive environmental impact, and alignment with myHerb's mission. Focusing on 3-5 trends initially is considered optimal for variety, manageability, focused content creation, and AI learning.\n",
        "*   Interactive features for eco-friendly trends could include showcases for upcycled items, quizzes on sustainable materials, DIY tutorial sharing, and progress trackers for actions like waste reduction.\n",
        "*   A community feed is envisioned as a central hub for users to share their sustainable living journey through photos, videos, text updates, and participation in trends. Proof of actions could be provided visually and through detailed descriptions, with community moderation and potential future AI analysis for verification.\n",
        "*   Leaderboards would gamify the experience, allowing users to earn points for completing actions, participating in trends, and engaging with the community, with different types of leaderboards available (overall, trend-specific, team, action-specific).\n",
        "*   The community feed would include standard social features like liking, commenting, sharing, following users, and mentions to foster interaction and inspiration.\n",
        "*   Moderation and content guidelines are deemed essential for a positive community, covering respectful communication, relevant content, anti-spam rules, accuracy, a reporting mechanism, and a moderation team.\n",
        "*   The \"Daily Viral Green Tip\" module would provide actionable, trend-linked tips via push notifications, generated through curated content and AI analysis that adapts tips to trending topics. Notifications would serve as timely reminders and prompts for engagement.\n",
        "*   User engagement with daily tips would be encouraged through clear calls to action, integration with interactive features, gamification (points, badges, streaks), progress visualization, impact metrics, community sharing prompts, and personalization.\n",
        "*   Design elements would include a colour palette evoking nature and energy (Deep Forest Green, Fresh Leaf Green, Earthy Brown/Beige, Sky Blue, Sunny Yellow), clean line iconography, modern sans-serif typography, a mix of illustrations and photography, and clean, spacious layouts optimized for mobile.\n",
        "*   Proposed UI interactions include smooth transitions, clear feedback on interactive elements, intuitive swipe gestures, light haptic feedback for key actions, pull-to-refresh, micro-animations for positive reinforcement, and interactive progress visuals.\n",
        "*   The design choices aim to align with myHerb's brand by visually communicating sustainability, creating a modern and fun user experience, ensuring easy navigation, and leveraging design elements to encourage viral engagement and a sense of collective achievement.\n",
        "*   Three additional app concept variations were suggested: Gamified Environmental Education (learning through quizzes, simulations, and unlockable content), Eco-Impact Tracking with Social Sharing (logging actions, visualizing personal and collective impact, and social sharing), and Influencer Collaborations (influencer-led challenges, exclusive content, live sessions, and collaborative goals).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Further detailed design mockups and user flows are needed to fully visualize and test the proposed UI elements and interactions.\n",
        "*   A technical feasibility study should be conducted to evaluate the implementation of AI trend scanning, real-time \"Trend-o-Meter\" updates, and robust community moderation features.\n"
